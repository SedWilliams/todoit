# Simple TODO List 

This program is nothing special. Just something I built while following a tutorial by @Coding in Flow (find him on YouTube) in order to fill in any React knowledge gaps I had,
and to get used to using TypeScript in combination with React. Tailwind is also something I got more comfortable with as a result of this project.

# What I learned...

* React
  * Learned the concept of dealing with the component tree, and passing data up and down the tree.
    * I made use of callbacks and passed props in order to transport data up and down the component tree.
  * Learned how to use custom and pre-made React hooks.
  * Practiced mapping state to component, and components based on state.

* Typescript + React
  * I learned how TypeScript interacts with React, as far as handling explicit typing and interfacing of things like props and components.
    * Created local and global interfaces to ensure creation, and leveraging, of explicit typing.

* Tailwind (Went into the project not being a big fan of Tailwind)
  * Setup and configured Tailwind CSS for the project.
  * Practiced using the utility class style of Tailwind, and became much more comfortable with it a result of this project.
